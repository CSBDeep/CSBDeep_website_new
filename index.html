# CSBDeep - a deep learning toolbox for microscopy image restoration and analysis

Fluorescence microscopy is a key driver of discoveries in life-sciences, and the CSBDeep toolbox is offering a collection of state-of-the-art methods for content-aware image restoration and segmentation. On this website we showcase a number of [real-world scenarios](https://frauzufall.github.io/csbdeep-testsite/scenarios) that might be useful in the context of your own work. Additionally, we will describe the respective [methods and tools](https://frauzufall.github.io/csbdeep-testsite/tools) we provide and link to further resources wherever we can.

The entire CSBDeep toolbox is fully open source and intended to be used from either Python or [Fiji](https://fiji.sc).
