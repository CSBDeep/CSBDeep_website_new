# CSBDeep - a toolbox for Content-aware Image Restoration (CARE)

Fluorescence microscopy is a key driver of discoveries in life-sciences, with observable phenomena being limited by the optics of the microscope, chemical and physical properties of fluorescent markers and the maximum photon exposure tolerated by the sample. These limits incur trade-offs between imaging speed, spatial resolution, light exposure and imaging depth, effectively reducing the quality of the acquired data and consequent analysis.

The CSBDeep toolbox is a collection of methods for content-aware image restoration and segmentation powered by deep learning. Using such tools, it is possible to acquire data at higher imaging speeds and lower spatial resolution without compromising the relevant information present in the dataset, allowing the acquisition of high informative data without the usual trade-offs associated with microscope imaging of live samples.

This webpage will act as the main information repository for all the tools associated with CSBDeep and the methods derived from it.
