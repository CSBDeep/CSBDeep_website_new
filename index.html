# CSBDeep - a toolbox for Content-aware Image Restoration

Fluorescence microscopy is a key driver of discoveries in life-sciences, with observable phenomena being limited by the optics of the microscope, chemical and physical properties of fluorescent markers and the maximum photon exposure tolerated by the sample. These limits incur trade-offs between imaging speed, spatial resolution, light exposure and imaging depth which reduces the information available. In order to acquire good enough data for image analysis, imaging speed is reduced, increasing phototoxicity and reducing the temporal resolution.

The CSBDeep toolbox is a collection of methods for content-aware image restoration and segmentation powered by deep learning that can recover high quality information withtout compromising speed, depth or resolution. Using such tools, it is possible to acquire data at higher imaging speeds and low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and later restore the dataset to a High SNR level with temporal information not previously achievable. This procedure, however, needs planning and a first acquisition of pairs of low and high SNR data in order to be trained. Such methods will be described in more detail in this webpage.

Explore the [Scenarios page](https://frauzufall.github.io/csbdeep-testsite/scenarios) for practical examples of the different tools.

The [Tools](https://frauzufall.github.io/csbdeep-testsite/tools) page describes the methods in more detail, where to get them and how to use them.
