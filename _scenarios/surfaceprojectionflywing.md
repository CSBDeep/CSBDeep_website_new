## Authorship

This work (method and data) is part of [Content-aware image restoration: pushing the limits of fluorescence microscopy](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0216-7) by Martin Weigert et al. in Nature Methods. 

## Details

An extended CARE Network offers the possibility to reconstruct low SNR images and simultaneously projects only relevant intensities embedded in imaged volumes. It can be seen that our results are a considerable improved compared to the output of other state-of-the-art projection algorithms (here we compare to results obtained by [Premosa](https://github.com/CBlasse/premosa)).

## Demo

The trained model is published for demonstration purposes. You can try it via Fiji and KNIME.

To run the demo in Fiji, [follow these instructions](https://github.com/CSBDeep/CSBDeep_website/wiki/Fiji-Command-%E2%80%93-Surface-Projection-(Flywing)).

To run the demo in KNIME, [follow these instructions](https://github.com/CSBDeep/CSBDeep_website/wiki/KNIME-Workflow-%E2%80%93-Surface-Projection-(Flywing)).
