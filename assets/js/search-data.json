Collect resources | Decide which information to copy to a joint documentation page and where to just keep links to existing pages | Integrate existing https://csbdeep.bioimagecomputing.com/ design | Add FAQs where it makes sense | Add guide for how to start - from Biologist’s perspective (I have problem X - can CSBDeep help me and if yes, how?) | Replace current https://csbdeep.bioimagecomputing.com/ content with new content | Announce |",

Don’t go much smaller than 5000K pixels, e.g. 2000x3000 or 1000x1000x5, … The more the merrier! If you use the Fiji plugin, you place many of them in the same folder and run the “train on folder” command pointing to this folder. You can use the same folder for training and validation, it will split up the data automatically and use 90% for training and 10% for validation. . What about SEM / TEM / CMOS? . Do training and test data need to be of the same dimensions? . No. You can train on bigger images and run the prediction on smaller images. The training data is internally split up into pieces and only a random subset of each batch is fed into the network. You also train on stacks, it’ll split them up again into batches internally. .",

          "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
          "content": "What is training? . Artificial neural networks are designed to solve specific tasks, like denoising an image or segmenting cells. Networks need to be trained. The training process includes feeding data into the network. The network will then learn characteristics of the input and it’s weights will iteratively be adjusted to solve the problem specific to the provided input data. . What is prediction? . A trained network can be used to guess the solution for a specific input. It does not need to be the same data which was used for training, but the network can return unexpected results if the input data varies too much from the training data. While training takes hours to complete, prediction is much faster. . I don’t want to train (long). . Me neither! But chances are high this will strongly improve the quality of the result and will avoid cases where a network predicts reasonable looking data which has nothing to do with reality. This is a serious risk of using artificial neural networks. . Some networks are trained on a wide range of data and can be generally useful. Or someone else has capacities to train a network on the type of images you want to apply prediction onto. These trained networks can be shared distributed to others e.g. as ZIP files. . How do I know if a pretrained network will solve my problem? . I made something new based on CSBDeep! .",
