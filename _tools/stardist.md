StarDist is a deep learning based cell/nuclei detection method for microscopy images. StarDist uses round star-convex shapes as detection primitives and is thus well suited for noisy images with many crowded/touching objects that can be well approximated  by round shapes such as nuclei.

For the full documentation and more detailed examples please have a look at the official [StarDist project page](https://github.com/mpicbg-csbd/stardist) or the [NEUBIAS Academy webinar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-oy7UpEhRfHQ-5ePCviKFg).
