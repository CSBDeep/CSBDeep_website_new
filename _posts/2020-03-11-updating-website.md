# Working on improving CSBDeep documentation

We are working on collecting all CSBDeep documentation resources at one place. Here's the plan:

1. Collect resources
2. Decide which information to copy to a joint documentation page and where to just keep links to existing pages
3. Integrate existing https://csbdeep.bioimagecomputing.com/ design
4. Add FAQs where it makes sense
5. Add guide for how to start - from Biologist's perspective (I have problem X - can CSBDeep help me and if yes, how?)
6. Replace current https://csbdeep.bioimagecomputing.com/ content with new content
7. Announce
